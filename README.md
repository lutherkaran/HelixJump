# HelixJump

Welcome to the world of Helix Jump, where bouncing balls and circular platforms come together for a wild and crazy adventure! 
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to guide the bouncing ball down a series of platforms while avoiding the dreaded forbidden zones. 
It's not as easy as it sounds, but fear not, for the game is simple and addictively fun!

To control the bouncing ball, you'll need to use your ninja-like reflexes to rotate the platforms and align the ball with the cracks. 
The more successful you are, the higher your score will be. And if you can manage to chain together a series of quick moves, 
you'll unleash the ultimate combo move and reach new levels of awesomeness!

But be warned, dear player: mastery of reflexes and looking ahead is crucial for success in this game. So, grab your lucky rabbit's foot, 
put on your game face, and get ready for the ride of your life. Helix Jump is waiting for you
